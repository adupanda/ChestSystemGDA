I have created a clash royale chest system where the user can place chests in 4 slots. 
Once a chest starts unlocking a timer starts after which the user can open that chest. 
If one chest is unlocking the user cannot start a timer for another chest.
The other way to unlock chests is to use gems and unlock chests instantly.
There are 4 different types of chests which have different rewards depending on their type. This was done using scriptable objects.
